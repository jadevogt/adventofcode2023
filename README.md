# advent of code 2023
This year I'm writing all of my solutions in C++ / Rust. I'm typically a Java & Python developer, so I'm still very new to writing code in these languages. The code in this repo is probably really cursed. You've been warned!

Everything before Day 3 was before I got cmake figured out and decided to organize things.
Everything after Day 8 is done in Rust
